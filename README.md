## 🌐 Traefik

The front-end reverse proxy (Traefik - **check [this guide](doc/traefik_v2_upgrade.md) if you still have the seedbox with Traefik v1**)  routes based on the lowest level subdomain (e.g. `deluge.example.com` would route to deluge). Since this is how the router works, it is recommended for you to get a top level domain. If you do not have one, you can edit your domains locally by changing your hosts file or use a browser plugin that changes the host header.

Traefik takes care of valid Let's Encrypt certificates and auto-renewal.

Note: Plex is also available directly through the `32400` port without going through the reverse proxy.

You can also add your own Traefik rules to integrate with other services (deployed wihthin docker or somewhere else on your LAN, or even on the Internet).
Check the [Configuration Guide](doc/configuration.md).

## ⚙️ Installation

### Dependencies

- [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) >= 20.10
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) >= 2.27.0
- [local-persist Docker plugin](https://github.com/MatchbookLab/local-persist): installed directly on host (not in container). This is a volume plugin that extends the default local driver’s functionality by allowing you specify a mountpoint anywhere on the host, which enables the files to always persist, even if the volume is removed via `docker volume rm`. Use *systemd* install for Ubuntu. **Since v2.2 the install script is bundled in seedbox's init script.**
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) >= 1.5
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases) >= 4

### Prepare your host

Before running, please create the volumes which will be statically mapped to the ones on the host:
For example:

```sh
sudo su -c "mkdir /data && mkdir /data/config && mkdir /data/torrents"
./init.sh
```

Edit the ``.env`` and ``.env.custom`` files and change the variables as desired.
The variables are all self-explanatory.

### Review the configuration

The configuration lives in the ``config.yaml`` file.

All you need to know is located in the [Configuration Guide](doc/configuration.md).

### Running & updating

```sh
./run-seedbox.sh
```

All services and synamic configuration will be automatically created without further action from your part.

Make sure you install the dependencies and finish configuration before doing this.

### Where is my data?

All data is saved in the docker volumes `seedbox_config` or
`seedbox_torrents`.
These volumes are mapped to the `config` and `torrents` folders located in `/data` on the host. You can change these static paths in the docker-compose.yml file.
Thanks to the **local-persist** Docker plugin, the data located in these volumes is persistent, meaning that volumes are not deleted, even when using the ```docker-compose down``` command. It would be a shame to loose everything by running a simple docker command ;-)
